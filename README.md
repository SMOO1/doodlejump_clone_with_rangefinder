This is a game similar to "Doodlejum" that i made with python on my raspberry pi, the user controls the game character horizontally by moving their hand left to right of an ultrasonic rangefinder. As the character gains altitude, platforms and jump boosters generate.    

resources used:
- breadboard
- raspberry pi with an extention cord 
- 6 wires
- ultrasonic rangefinder
